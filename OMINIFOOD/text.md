 ## First Ideas and Sketch

 ## Design and development
 



 ## PRINCIPLE OF RESPONSIVE DESIGN
 --Before starting your project make sure, you start with responsive design.

 --What is Responsive web-design
Design techniques to make a webpage adjust its layout and visual style to any possible screen size(window or viewport size)
in Practice, this means that responsive design makes websites usable on all devices, such as desktop computers,tablets, and mobile phones 

It a set of practices, not a separate technology. its just CSS 


 ##  RESPONSIVE DESIGN INGREDIENTS 

 ## --FLUID LAYOUTS 
-To allow webpage to adapt to current viewport width(or even height)
-Use % percentage(or vh/vw) unit instead of px for elements that should adapt to viewport(usually layout)
-Use max-with instead of width

## --RESPONSIVE UNITS 
-Use rem unit instead of px for most lengths
-To make it easy to scale the entire layout down(or up)automatically

Note: setting 1rem to 10px for easy calculations

## --FLEXIBLE IMAGES
-By default, images dont scale automatically as we change the viewport, so we need to fix that

-Always use % percentage for immage dimensions, together with the max-width property 


## --Media Queries 
-Bring responsive sites to life, allow developers to create different versions of a website for different types of devices because different devices has differnt width.

-To change CSS styles on certain viewport widths(called breakpoints)

We need to start creating a fluid layout,responsive units and Flexible images  from the very begining.



# STRATEGIES IN BUILDING A WEBSITE 

## -- DESKTOP-FIRST VS MOBILE-FIRST DEVELOPMENT

--Start writing CSS for the desktop: large screen 
--Then, media queries shrink design to smaller screens.
